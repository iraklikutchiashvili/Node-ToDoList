# To Do List


## About

To Do list application where you can add tasks, delete them, and create your own lists just by replacing (/personal)
at the end of the URL with (/yourkeyword).


## My process

Used the following technologies: Mongodb (Mongoose ) - to perform CRUD operations in the database, connected to Mongodbatlas,
used EJS templates and layouts - to dynamically change markup using EJS tags, Expressjs routing - how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URLs)
respond to client's requests, and its routing parameters - to capture the values specified at their position in the URL and render pages according to them,
body-parser - to parse post requests, Lodash library - to capitalize values in the URL, Git, Github for version control and etc...
